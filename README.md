### Teams

```
If you want to create an environment where people are free and encouraged to create, first and foremost, consider the following:

Cancel all recurring meetings every so often to reset.

Make a list of the real problems these meetings were designed to solve.

Find dynamic, temporary solutions to these problems that are as flexible as you want your team to be (this can include meetings as long as they have expiration dates).

Make and prioritize time to help your colleagues grow completely separate from the work at hand.

Enforce free time for teams to sit, work and talk with each other naturally.

If you need a meeting to align everyone, schedule 30 minutes once a week for rapid-fire roadblock busting.

Be rigorous about when and how you test to save time and resources.

Revisit and revise all of the processes and policies youâ€™ve created so that nothing becomes too permanent.
