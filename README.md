### Operating Principles

### Making decisions

### 1-1

### Teams

* Cancel all recurring meetings every so often to reset.

* Make a list of the real problems these meetings were designed to solve.

* Find dynamic, temporary solutions to these problems that are as flexible as you want your team to be (this can include meetings as long as they have expiration dates).

* Make and prioritize time to help your colleagues grow completely separate from the work at hand.

* Enforce free time for teams to sit, work and talk with each other naturally.

* Be rigorous about when and how you test to save time and resources.

* Revisit and revise all of the processes and policies youâ€™ve created so that nothing becomes too permanent.

* To grow successfully, you need to keep pushing the ability to make decisions down through the ranks, so that the people closest to the work can make high-quality, responsible calls.

#### Growth Frameworks

### Meetings

* Cancel all recurring meetings every so often to reset.

* Make a list of the real problems these meetings were designed to solve.

* If you need a meeting to align everyone, schedule 30 minutes once a week for rapid-fire roadblock busting.
