## Notes


* If a factory is torn down but the rationality which produced it is left standfing, then the rationality will simple produce another factory
* A system is a set of things, people, molecules or whatever interconnected in such a way that they produce their own pattern of behaviour over time
* The informatioon delivered by a feedback loop can only affect fugture behavior. It can't deliver a signal fast enoug to correct behavior that drove the current feedback
* when a subsystem's goals dominate at the expense of the total system's goals
* eveerything we think we konw about the world is a model.
* Models fall far short of representing the real world
* if a goal is defined badly, if it doesn't measure what it's supposed to measure, if it doesnt' reflect the real welfare of the system, the the system can't possibly produce a desirable result
* if the desired system state is national security, and measured as the amount of money spent on military, the suystem will produce military spending - not national security
* Education measured by performance on standardized tests, the system will produce performance on standardized tests
* social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strenghts and weaknesses
