After running many projects, I've come to realize that they follow a pattern - of course! And that gives me an opportunity to make an algorithm for it.


The number one problem I've encountered in most projects is not a technical or a domain issue. Instead, it's a communication or missalignment one. With that, Here's my checklist to avoid issues and increase chances of success

Before you begin any project, be sure this document is filled out.

1. Meet with all stakeholders of the project, including team members and fill this out together. Warning, it may be long and get heated but it's worth it.


### Project

* Why do this project?
* What do we expect to get out of the first version?
* What do we expect to get out of the stable version?
* How do we know this is a good idea?
* Have you asked your users?

### Roles

* Who's part of the project
  * PM
  * TL
  * Dev
  * UX
  * Data
  * Support

### End goal

* Define what success looks like for version 1
* Define what success looks like for version n

### Metrics

* What metrics will you use for version 1?
* What metrics will we use for version n?

### Timelines

* Version 1 release timeframe
* Version n release timeframe
