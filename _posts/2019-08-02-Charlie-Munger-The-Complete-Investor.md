## Notes


## General

* Observe what works and what doesn’t and understand why
* Investing is simple but not easy
* Munger: Life is too short to do business with people you don’t like
* The most effective way to genuinely reduce risk is to know what you’re doing
* No one should buy an investment merely because it’s better than the lousy one you just saw/owned
* Success means being patient  but aggressive when it’s time
* If you don’t get elementary probability into your repertoire, you go through life flying blind
* if you get heavy ideology when you’re young, you’re locking your brain
* Problem with ideology is that you stop thinking when it comes to hard issues
* You gotta work where you’re turn on
* One way to avoid mistakes is to have someone to run your decisions by
* How a person responds emotionally to events is more important than intelligence
* Skin in the game: No situations where managers win and managers don’t lose
* Integrity and reputation are your most valuable assets - and can be lost in a heartbeat
* Buffet and Munger are not interested in investing in company turnarounds because they seldom do

## 3 Elements

* Principles
    * Treat a share of stock os a proportional ownership of a business
    * Buy a  significant discount to intrinsict value to create margin of safety
    * Make the market your servant and not your master
    * Be rational objective and dispassionate
* The right stuff
    *
* Variables

## Basics of Graham investing principle

* it’s not possible to consistently outperform the market
* Understand what the company sell, who are their customers
* If it’s too hard to understand, move on
* To outperform the market, you must be a contrarian. Must be right enough occasions
    * it’s much easier to follow the crowd than be a contrarian
* Understand how a company generates cash flow
* Making successful predictions about complex systems is aprocess in which errors are inevitable. → Having a margin of safety paramount
* Prices will sway above and under intrinsic value, don’t try to predict
* If you’re the crowd, you cannot, by definition, beat the crowd
* Rationality is the best antidote to making psychological and emotional errors
* Best quality of Munger → Rationality

## Worldly Wisdom

* You can’t really know anything if you just remember facts
* You must know the big ideas
* People who think broadly make better decisions
* It’s better to be wordly wise than understand on a single model that is precisely wrong
* Munger == Fox → knows a little about a lot
    * Rather than a hedgehog
* Go over decision making process carefully using skills, ideas and models from many disciplines
* Focus on learning from mistakes
* If you cannot explain why you failed, the business is too complex
* Extreme mistakes in Berkshire’s history have been mistakes of omission

## Psychology of Misjudgement

* You get what you are rewarded for
* Loss aversion: People put more emphasis in losses than gains
    * I rather not lose $10 than pay $10 more for an item
* Liking/Loving tendency: Admiration causes or intensifies liking or love (feedback loop)
    * People deny/ignore distort facts of people they like/love/admire
* Doubt avoidance tendency: People tend to avoid subjects they don’t know or have doubts about even if that’s the best path
* Systems
    * System 1: experiential. It’s fast, automatic and difficult to control
    * System 2: Analytical system. It’s slow (Thinking Fast and Slow)
* Inconsistency-avoidance: Reluctant to change when information given conflicts with what they already believe
* Fairness tendency: tolerating a little unfairness to get a greater fairness for all is a the model we should all strive for
* Envy/Jealousy Tendency: If you’re comfortably rich and someone else is getting richer fast, so what? There will always be someone
* Reciprocation Tendency: Humans reciprocate favours and disfavours in an extreme manner
* Influence from association: Brands associate with other brands or people that other like
* Pain avoidance psychological denial: One should recognize reality even if one doesn’t like it
* Over-Optimism Tendency: People tend to underestimate
* Deprival super reaction tendency (loss aversion)
    * we feel losses about 2 or 2.5 times more than gains

## Moats

* Supply-side economies of scale
    * Average costs fall when more of a product or service is produced
* Demand-side economies of scale
    * Network effects
    * when a product becomes more valuable as more people use it
* Brand
* Regulation
* Patents and intellectual property
