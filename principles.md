> Principles are ways of successfully dealing with reality to get what you want out of life.
Ray Dalio <https://www.principles.com/>

Like Ray Dalio, I also realized that there are patterns in life that always apply to the way one ones to live. Those are Principles. This page is a living document where I will record those that apply to me.

### Operating Principles

* Operating Principles: document way you work

* Describe how decisions are made

* Decentralize decision making

* To grow successfully, you need to keep pushing the ability to make decisions down through the ranks, so that the people closest to the work can make high-quality, responsible calls.  Not localizing problem-solving is a secret killer of companies.




### 1-1

### Teams

* Cancel all recurring meetings every so often to reset.

* Make a list of the real problems these meetings were designed to solve.

* Find dynamic, temporary solutions to these problems that are as flexible as you want your team to be (this can include meetings as long as they have expiration dates).

* Make and prioritize time to help your colleagues grow completely separate from the work at hand.

* Enforce free time for teams to sit, work and talk with each other naturally.

* Be rigorous about when and how you test to save time and resources.

* Revisit and revise all of the processes and policies youâ€™ve created so that nothing becomes too permanent.

* To grow successfully, you need to keep pushing the ability to make decisions down through the ranks, so that the people closest to the work can make high-quality, responsible calls.

### Meetings

* Ban update meetings

* Book room in advance

* Define the intention of the meeting and be sure everyone is aware. Start with the goal

* Have an agenda that drives towards that goal

* Keep the short. Start with 30 as the default but don't go over 1hr

* Keep them small. No more than 7 people

* Ban devices

* Appoint somebody to run the meeting

* At the end of the meeting while everybody is still there, be sure to go over the actionable items

* Action and owner should be very clear

* Send the actionable items via email right after the meeting

* Cancel all recurring meetings every so often to reset.
